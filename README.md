# TreeVisualizer
This is a small Java program that takes a tree in level_order format as a command line argument, and pretty prints it on the console.

How to use:
1. Download the repository, extract the zip file, and navigate to TreeVisualizer-main directory.
2. Open your terminal in that directory(You must run all commands from this directory). In windows, you can SHIFT+RIGHT_CLICK inside file explorer, and select "Open Power Shell Window here".
3. I am assuming you have the JDK installed, and the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set so that you can use it from the command line.
4. Compile the Source code stored in the source directory: "javac source/*java"
5. Run the compiled code from the same directory as follows: "java source.TreeVisualizer [1,2,3,null,4]"
6. Substitute any small tree structure to visualize.

Have fun!
